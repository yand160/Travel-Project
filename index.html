                    <h2>Why Marseille?</h2>
                    <h3>Marseille has one of the largest ports of the Mediterranean sea.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Marseille is one of the Mediterranean’s major seaports and the second largest city in France, it
                        is located on the Gulf of Lion, west
                        of the French Riviera.
                        Marseille is also the oldest of the large French cities, Marseille was founded as Massalia
                        (Massilia) by Greek mariners from Phocaea in
                        Asia Minor about 600 BC. Archaeological finds exhibited in the Museum of Antiquities in the
                        18th-century Château Borély
                        suggest that Phoenicians had settled there even earlier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Marseille is known for many things but primarily for its unique culture and cuisine, including
                        the garlic- and
                        saffron-flavoured fish stew called bouillabaisse. Marseille, France, is also the birthplace of
                        that iconic soap, <em>Savon de Marseille</em>. Since the Middle Ages, the Marseille soap
                        has been made from olive oil without colors or preservatives. The authentic Savon de Marseille
                        are made using centuries old methods. Marseille is a city you will love to visit when you are in
                        France.

                            <p>
                                The Palais Longchamp is a monument in the 4th arrondissement of Marseille, France. It
                                houses the Musée des beaux-arts
                                and Muséum d'histoire naturelle de Marseille. The surrounding Longchamp Park is listed
                                by the French Ministry of Culture
                                as one of the Notable Gardens of France. From each side of the water reservoir, an open
                                colonnade leads to two museums which face a cascade on the city side, and
                                a large garden on the park side. The site location was a central point for the European
                                Capital of Culture title awarded to Marseille in 2013. The ‘Palais Longchamp’ hosted a
                                zoo from 1855 to 1987, the Big Zoo of Marseille, which was also the first provincial zoo
                                in France.

                                The gardens are beautiful with massive waterfalls you sit outside and listen to the
                                waterfalls. Both museums are
                                massive and showcase paintings, sculptures, and drawings from the 17th and 18th
                                century. You could spend your whole day browsing throughout both museums.

                                grams of gold every quarter century. Its construction required more than 40 years of
